## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ Successful Operations Should Show:

- **Update**: "Service updated successfully!"
- **Delete**: "Service deleted successfully!"

### 📊 Data Display Should Include:
- **Services List**: All services with client/vendor names
- **Service Details**: Complete service information
- **Client Integration**: Services filtered by client
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators

### 🎨 UI Features to Verify:
- **Dynamic Form**: Add/remove service rows
- **Pre-selection**: Client selected when coming from client details
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile devices
- **Action Buttons**: View, Edit, Delete with proper icons

## 🔧 Advanced Testing

### Multiple Services Creation
1. **Create 3+ services** for the same client
2. **Use different vendors** for each service
3. **Verify all services** appear in both:
   - Services list (`/services`)
   - Client details page

### Status Management
1. **Create services** with different statuses
2. **Verify badge colors:**
   - Active: Green (success)
   - Inactive: Gray (secondary)
   - Pending: Yellow (warning)
   - Expired: Red (danger)

### Relationship Testing
1. **Delete a client** that has services
2. **Verify:** Services are also deleted (cascade)
3. **Delete a vendor** that has services
4. **Verify:** Services are also deleted (cascade)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Table doesn't exist" Error
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### "Route not found" Error
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan route:cache
```

### "Class not found" Error
```bash
composer dump-autoload
```

### Foreign Key Constraint Error
- Ensure clients and vendors exist before creating services
- Check that client_id and vendor_id reference existing records

## 📱 Mobile Testing

**Test Responsive Design:**
1. **Resize browser** to mobile size
2. **Check form layout** - should stack vertically
3. **Test table scrolling** - should scroll horizontally
4. **Verify button sizes** - should be touch-friendly
5. **Test dynamic form** - add/remove buttons should work

## 🚀 Performance Testing

### Large Dataset Testing
1. **Create 20+ services** with different clients/vendors
2. **Check page load time** for services list
3. **Test client details** with many services
4. **Verify pagination** (if implemented)

## 🎯 Success Criteria
